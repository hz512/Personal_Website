            <h5>Deep Learning Based Occupants’ Activity Prediction Towards Designing A Smart Building Assistant System</h5> 
            <span class="tab">In Fall 2019, our research primarily focused on the application of deep learning in smart buildings. 
            Several Ph.D. students in the lab and I propose a smart building assistance system consisting of different 
            sensors data analysis and DNN-based prediction model to improve the comfort level of building 
            occupants and reduce energy consumption.

                    alt="Overview of the proposed smart building system">
                </li>
                <li class="list_inline_item" style="max-width: 690px;">
                    <span class="tab">We collected a year-long smart building dataset from four different data sources (i.e., sensors, calendar,
                    weather, and survey). Then we proposed a support vector regression based prediction model and a hybrid DNN model 
                    consisting of several RNN blocks and a feed-forward DNN block so that different physical features (e.g., 
                    lighting) can be predicted for different building activities (e.g., meeting).
                    <br>
                    <span class="tab">Extensive experimental studies was conducted to evaluate the performance of the 
                    proposed prediction models and the activity-wise comfort levels. Experiments reveal that the proposed system is 
                    able to increase occupants’ comfortability by adaptively changing the indoor environmental features (e.g., 
                    temperature) and reducing the gaps between indoor and outdoor environments.

            <h5>Implementation of a fully distributed load rebalancing algorithm on MapReduce</h5>
            <span class="tab">In Spring 2019, I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw8c/"
                class= "research_pages" rel="external" target="_blank">Haoyu Wang</a> and Zetian Liu on a Hadoop MapReduce project.
            We modified the source code of MapReduce so that we could implement a fully distributed load rebalancing
            algorithm on MapReduce. The ultimate goal is to realize selective data replications among diffetent datacenters.
            <br>
            <span class="tab">The load rebalancing algorithm is proposed and its effectiveness is thoroughly discussed and tested in 
            below two papers.
