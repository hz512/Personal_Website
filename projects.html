          <h5>Optimal Review Ranking for Improving Shopper’s Decision Making<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Spring 2020)</small></h5> 
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Group members: Akhil Sai Peddireddy (ap3ub), Kai Qu (kq4ff), 
          Rakshita Kaulgud Ramesh (rrk7pb), and Haoran Zhu (hz3fr) [All members were CS students at UVA.]</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">We developed a system that provides personalized ranking of  customer reviews for each shooper. Using 
          cumulative position-weighted score, we were able to demonstrate that there is 
          an average of 20% increase in user satisfaction using our personalized ranking system compared to the default Amazon
          ranking system.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Also, we proposed a method of rating products at term level based on users’ preferences. 
          For example, if a user cares very much about the price of a product, we’ll offer another rating of the product
          solely based on the price factor. This method can be applied to recommendation systems to provide accurate recommendations.
          <br>
          <span class="tab">The project report is available 
          <a href="projects_pdf/presonalized_ranking_report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Full implementation is also available
          upon query.

          <br>
          <span class="tab">We developed an application that allows UVA students to sell and purchase meal swipes at UVA dinning halls. 
          The application was built primarily using Django framework under agile software development standards.
          Some of the tools we used while developing this application are Docker, MySQL, Apache JMeter, Apache Kafka, Elastic Search,
          Travis CI, Selenium, and Spark. 
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Full implementation of our application is available upon query.

          <span class="tab">A Craigslist website (<a href="https://charlottesville.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">What is Craigslist?</a>) 
          designed specifically for UVA students. The application was built primarily using Django framework under agile software development 
          standards. OAuth-based Google Sign-in was implemented to make sure that UVA students can sign-in using their UVA emails.

          <h5>DeepArt: Identify Artist from Painting<small style="font-size: 0.8rem"> (Fall 2019)</small></h5>
          <span class="tab"><span class="group_members">Group members: Kai Qu(kq4ff), Daniel Xiao (zx8yz), and Haoran Zhu (hz3fr) 
          [All members were CS students at UVA.]</span>
          <br>
          <span class="tab">We adapted and fine-tune different pretrained models (ResNet50, GoogLeNet, VGGNet11) to a dataset that 
          contains artworks of 50 the most influential artists of all time and compare the results to our baseline model (ResNet18).
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Furthermore, we trained another identical ResNet50 Model (call it ResNet50_2). However, during the 
          training of ResNet50_2, we freezed deeper layers to only train shallow layers to capture the overall styles of different 
          paintings, comparing this result to the one merely by fine-tuning approach. 
          <br>
          <span class="tab">Our ResNet 50_2 model outperforms all other pretrained models by at least 1.5% in all the metrics we used.
          This validates our speculation that shallow layers play a more important role in understanding the overall style of 
          paintings than deep layers.
